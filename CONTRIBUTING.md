# Contribution

## Preconsideration

Please keep the following in mind BEFORE contributing:

- This project is mainly a private endeavour into game engine coding(I have been doing already for many years now) and a way for me to learn new things, 
especially in software architecture. 

- The engine may do similar things other well established engines already do. 

- There are certain topics I really would like to do on my own for learing purposes. 
So not everything what comes to your mind might be available for implementation. 


## Passed any Doubts?

**Anyway, the project welcomes you and we are happy you came to this point!**

It is very important to communicate what you want to do BEFORE you do it. 

If you still have any doubts, do not hesitate contacting me.

Happy hacking.
